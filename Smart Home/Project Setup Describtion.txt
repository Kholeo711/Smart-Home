This Smart Home Automation project demonstrates a functional prototype of a secure and interactive home system. It integrates various sensors and components to create a comprehensive solution for modern home automation. The system includes password-protected door access, car detection for garage entry, and environmental monitoring using an LDR and temperature sensor.

Features:

 Secure Door Access:

   A 3x4 keypad is used for password entry.
   An LCD display indicates whether the password is correct or incorrect.
   A buzzer is triggered for incorrect password attempts.
   A servo motor unlocks the door when the correct password is entered.
   Car Detection for Garage Entry:

   An IR sensor detects the presence of a car.
   A servo motor rotates to open or close the garage door accordingly.
 

 Environmental Monitoring:

   An LDR sensor (Light-Dependent Resistor) detects ambient light levels for automatic light control.
   A temperature sensor measures the temperature and can trigger additional actions or notifications as needed.
 

 Interactive Design:

   The prototype is constructed using laser-cut MDF material.
   Modular and compact, the design is easy to assemble and enhance.
 

 Components Used:
   
   Arduino Uno
   3x4 Keypad // [ROW_NUM] = {A5, A4} // [COLUMN_NUM] = {A3, A2}
   LCD Display //rs = 13, en = 12, d4 = 11, d5 = 10, d6 = 9, d7 = 8
   IR Sensors //Pins 1,& 2
   LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) //Pin A1
   Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35 or DHT11/DHT22) //Pin A0
   Buzzer //Pin 0
   Servo Motors // Pins 3,& 4
   Fan // Pin 5
   Breadboard and Jumper Wires
   Transitor or Relay
   

 How It Works:

   The keypad allows users to input a password. If the password is correct, the LCD displays a success message, and the door opens. Otherwise, the system displays an error message and activates the buzzer.
   The IR sensor in the garage section detects a vehicle and signals the servo to open the garage door.
   The LDR monitors light levels to adjust lighting or activate night mode.
   The temperature sensor continuously monitors the environment  to turn a dc fan based on the temperature using a transistor or a relay and can be used for alerts or automation.
